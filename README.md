 The objective of the Library Management System project is to create a comprehensive software
 solution for efficiently managing library operations. The system is designed to automate various
 tasks involved in library management, including book cataloging, user management, transaction
 tracking, and inventory management.

 Functionality:

 Book Management:

 Users can add new books to the system by providing details such as book
 name, author name, and unique book ID. The system ensures that each book has a unique
 identifier and tracks its availability status.
 User Management:
 The system allows administrators to manage user information, including user
 IDs, names, and contact details. Users can be added, edited, or removed from the system as
 needed.

 Transaction Tracking:
 The system records transactions such as book issuance and return, along
 with relevant details such as the book ID, user ID, and transaction date. This helps in keeping
 track of book circulation and user activity.

 Inventory Management:
 The system maintains an inventory of all books in the library, including
 their current status (available or issued). Administrators can view, update, and delete book
 records as necessary to keep the inventory up-to-date.

 Search Functionality:
 Users can search for books by book name or author name to quickly find
 relevant titles. The system provides search functionality to streamline the process of locating
 books within the library database.
 GUI Interface:
 The system features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows
 users to interact with the software easily. The GUI includes forms for data entry, buttons for
 performing actions, and displays for viewing book records.

Data Validation:

 The system incorporates data validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and
 accuracy of information entered into the database. It validates user input to prevent errors and
 inconsistencies in the system.
 Overall, the Library Management System aims to simplify library operations, enhance user
 experience, and improve efficiency in managing library resources. By automating routine tasks
 and providing robust functionality, the system facilitates smooth operation of library services and
 promotes effective resource utilization.
